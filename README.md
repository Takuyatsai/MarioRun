This is a simple game with python. I want to build a game looks like the "Dinosaur Game" at Chrome, and my first idea is super 
mario.
In this project, there are two versions, one is play by yourself, and another one is script itself which is based on genetic 
algorithm, it is cool because it is my first time build an AI game. Hope you like it.
